# Dockerize Spring Microservices with Eureka Server and Gateway

## Overview

This project demonstrates the process of containerizing Spring Microservices with Eureka Server for service discovery and a Gateway for routing requests. Dockerization provides a consistent and reproducible environment, making it easier to manage dependencies, deployment, and scaling of microservices.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
